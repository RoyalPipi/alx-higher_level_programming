This  project is a little bit different than the usual projects.
Trying examples in the Python interpreter will give you most of the answers without having to think about it. 
But for this project, First read, then think, then brainstorm with others. Only then you can test in the interpreter. Note that during interviews for Python positions, you will most likely have to answer to these type of questions.
